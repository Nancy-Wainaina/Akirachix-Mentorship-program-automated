    <p><b>Born A Crime by Trevor Noah</b> <br>
        <br>
        These two chapters dive into the life of a mixed-race child growing up during apartheid in South Africa raised by a strict Christian mother. <br>
        Trevor narrates the story of his mother’s unwavering faith and the challenges they faced due to the racial segregation Imposed by apartheid. In <br>this chapter, it highlights the tribal conflicts between the Zulu and Xhosa tribes. <br>
        <br> Being raised in a Christian household, <br>Trevor is still not convinced that they should go to church every Sunday. <br>On the other hand, Trevor’s mother is governed by church and she wouldn't be convinced by any of Trevor’s excuses not  to go to church. <br> Trevor’s mother is determined to keep her son safe even if it's risking her life to save him from a gang attack. <br>
        <br>
         Starts with apartheid and its oppressive laws. Trevor was born to a white father and a black mother, and that union was illegal at that time. <br> This chapter shows the cruelty of apartheid as Trevor’s existence was considered a crime. <br>
         Connecting these issues to my county Nairobi, It's clear that discrimination is still taking place, where people coming from humble backgrounds are not <br> given jobs in high-class workplaces. Some are even considered outcasts. The theme of resilience in the face of misfortune is universal. In Nairobi, <br>we also have a division of churches, where some are considered for the rich and others considered for the poor.
